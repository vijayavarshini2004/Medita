            <p>Your life has all of the colors sucked out of it.Instead of red, blue, yellow, everything is just grey....once i was suffering from depression and I overcame it without any medicines.
<br/>A few weeks ago I came across your website called Medita on Google while I was searching for an anonymous platform to talk and vent out. And my first experience was definitely amazing, the first mWarrior I connected with, her username was Peacescape (do convey my regards if you guys connect with her as wellðŸ™ƒ), was so kind, empathetic and easy to talk to, in fact it actually felt like talking to a good friend.
<br/>Do give it a try guys, hope you have a great experience as well!ðŸ¤ž</p>
